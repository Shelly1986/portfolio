      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am Shelly Sachdev. I am a Computer Science/ICT teacher from India. Teaching was not a conscious choice, but it is something that happened to me, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the journey so far. All my experience since 2010 has been with the Middle and Secondary students and during these 12 years, I have had the pleasure of teaching in three different countries.
      </p>

      <p>My journey of being an educator started in India where I taught IB and Cambridge courses, and it was such a gratifying experience. From India to China and then to Poland, it was a big leap of faith with huge challenges pertaining to meeting expectations in a new professional environment and accepting a new home away from home every time I moved countries. </p>

      <p>Over these years, I have gained experience in dealing with a diverse group of learners across age groups 11 - 18. I love teaching Computer Science because of the fact that I get to teach a variety of topics such as Scratch, Office suite, Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Python turtle, coding in Javascript, creating GUI apps in Python with sqlite and so much more. The age range and variety has really helped me develop a range of skills over these years.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I love to watch documentaries on Netflix, writing short poems, and reading books but playing with my toddler tops the list.</p>

      <p>I believe that in one lifetime, we don't always have to be the same person doing the same thing and so I want to take another leap of faith and switch to technical writing because writing as well as Computer Science fascinate me and I want to combine them both and add more flavor in my journey as a lifelong learner.</p>

      <p>I am sure if given a chance, I would excel at this new chosen path because I am highly teachable and love to work on my skills.</p>
    
        <p>
        Having made up my mind to explore Tech. writing as a future career, I am starting this journal to document the areas that I have taught in the field of Computer Science which might help my students, myself or anyone else who is interested to learn about these topics.
        On that note, I wish myself all the best!</p>
